# Gambling Addiction & Psychology - DSA210 Project

## Project Overview

This project explores the psychological aspects of gambling addiction, analyzing how traits like impulsivity, greed, loss aversion, and narcissism influence gambling behavior. Using machine learning models and sentiment analysis, we aim to predict at-risk gamblers and identify relapse triggers based on behavioral and financial data.

By leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques, this project will uncover patterns and test hypotheses about the relationship between psychological traits and gambling behavior. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can help individuals, policymakers, and mental health professionals better understand gambling addiction.

## Motivation

Gambling addiction is a growing issue worldwide, affecting millions of people financially and psychologically. This project aims to explore the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive addictive gambling behavior, using a data-driven approach to provide insights into prevention and intervention strategies. By analyzing real-world gambling behavior and sentiment trends, we can develop a more profound understanding of:

-Why people continue gambling despite significant losses (loss aversion & sunk cost fallacy).
-How personality traits (such as impulsivity and narcissism) correlate with addiction risk.
-What emotional triggers cause gambling relapse (social media analysis).

Understanding these factors will not only contribute to academic research but also help casinos, financial institutions, and mental health professionals create better strategies to mitigate gambling addiction.
